A small restaurant wants a personalized table booking system where customer
can book a table for that particular day only. A system that can be used at the
reception to book a table for the customer on a phone call or in person.

There is a document in the repo named "DFS_DOCUMENT_FINAL.pdf" which is written by me and contains the specifications of this WPF application

Here are some of the screenshots -
